\section{Cataloging voronoi polygons for all sizes of a general window}
Same as with the rhombic window the goal is to pick several fixed sizes of the window whose voronoi polygons catalogs cover the global voronoi polygon catalog. Solution comes from the idea that while increasing the size of the window linearly, the sizes of the hyper-window and hypo-window also grow linearly. Of course these windows are rhombi and have properties from Theorem \ref{the:quasiProperties}.
$$\quasi{\beta\Omega} = \frac{1}{\beta}\quasi{\Omega} $$
Thus the interval $\left(\frac{1}{\beta},1\right]$ is divided by the length of the word into intervals and any one size is analyzed from within each interval. 

The next section will apply these findings to a circle.
